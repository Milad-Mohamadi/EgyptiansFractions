<div id="sequence">

        The "look and say" sequence is defined as follows: beginning with the term 1, each subsequent term visually describes the digits appearing in the previous term. The first few terms are as follows:

        1
        11
        21
        1211
        111221
        As an example, the fourth term is 1211, since the third term consists of one 2 and one 1.

        Given an integer N, print the Nth term of this sequence.
